# Haskell Fun - Part 4 - Record Syntax, Monoids?, ...

### Record syntax for abstract data types (ADTs)

If our ADT has just one constructor, we can name the elements of the type using
what's known as the *record syntax*:

```
data Car = Car { carMake :: String, carModel :: String }
```

This defines not only the `Car` constructor, but also the `carMake` and
`carModel` getter/setters.

```
show' (Car make model) = make ++ " " ++ model  -- regular pattern matching
show'' c = carMake c ++ " " ++ carModel c      -- using getters

oldCar = Car "Toyota" "Corolla"                -- regular construction
otherCar = Car { carMake = "Nissan", carModel = "Pathfinder" }
newCar = oldCar { carModel = "Corona" }        -- create new based on old
```

### Semigroups and monoids

Semigroup is a type class for all types with an associative binary operation.

```
class Semigroup a where
  (<>) :: a -> a -> a                    -- this must be associative
```

Monoid is a type class for all types with an identity and associative binary
operation.

````
class Semigroup a => Monoid a where
  mempty :: a                            -- the identity value

sconcat :: Monoid a => [a] -> a
sconcat [] = mempty
sconcat (x:xs) = x <> sconcat xs

stimes :: Int -> a -> a
stimes n x | n < 0 = error "Cannot do scalar multiplication of a Monoid"
stimes n x = _
